Welcome to Atari-Gwent!
Made by comcast_wizard

Atari Gwent is a text-based version of Witcher 3's card game, Gwent, reimagined in a form of an Atari 2600 game. (Although Atari would've had better graphics than this game, but I just liked the sound of 'Atari Gwent', so there is that.)

It was my first 'big' project and does have it's problems such as the mixed use of camel case and snake case, and insufficent coding due to my lack of skills, but I still hope you enjoy it.

Thank you and have a nice day!
